	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Sun]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Novus Horizontum^N
			%description = Novus Horizontum is a G4 type main sequence star on the far side of the galaxy. It is, however, somewhat unique among G-type stars in that its size and luminosity are a fair bit larger than other stars of the same temperature and mass. Due to this, the star has the luminosity class IV, indicating that it is a sub-giant. Astronomers are uncertain if this is merely a result of the star's relatively large metallicity--the proportion of elements in the star which are not hydrogen or helium--or if it is because the star is nearing the end of its life on the main sequence and is transitioning into a giant. The star is host to a large planetary system with several gas giants and terrestrial planets.

	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Ernus]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Despite its small size, Ernus was fairly easy to discover, being so ridiculously close to its parent subgiant star that though it produced only a tiny transit signal, it produced that signal just every few days.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Moh]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Moh is an ice giant planet as far away from ice as it gets. Its short period around its star implies that it gets plenty of the hot.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Moho]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Momoon
			%description = A large moon was discovered around Moh to explain weirdness in transit timing variations. 
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Arin]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Arin was initially thought to be a much larger planet than it really is, but further analysis of its very strangely shaped transit light-curve showed that the hot planet, in fact, had rings!
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Astid]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = It is likely that any world with rings would have a shepard moonlet or two within the rings, but of course none are actually known.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Atell]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = During an analysis of several years of transit data from Arin, astronomers have discovered an exomoon orbiting it.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Eve]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Fve
			%description = An almost perfect clone of Eve in mass and radius has been detected around Novus Horizontum. Astronomers are keen on finding out if this body is as purple as our Eve.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Laythe]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Maythe
			%description = Maythe is a kerbin-sized world orbiting on the inner edge of the habitable zone of Novus Horizontum. The possibility of the existence of life here has excited many an astrobiologist, but others insist that Maythe is so close to its star that it surely must be more of an Eveian hell world.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Derso]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = A large moon of Maythe was discovered orbiting it through the now tried-and-true "studying existing transit light curves very closely" method. The pair are fairly close in size and orbit to Kerbin and Mun.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Sonnah]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Sonnah is a large gas giant orbiting Novus Horizontum within the outer region of the habitable zone. That fact would be uninteresting, were it not for the fact that several large satellites have been discovered orbiting it.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Mun]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Nuna
			%description = Nuna is a Mun-sized moon found orbiting Sonnah.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Aptur]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Not much is known about the minor moons of Novus Horizontum's planets.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Kerbin]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Munbin
			%description = A Kerbin-sized moon orbiting Sonnah, far enough apart from Sonnah to be easily detected by transit data.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Eli]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = This small moon seemingly appeared out of nowhere right in the middle of a transit. It was initially thought to be spurious, and though it has never been precovered in earlier transit images, its existence has by now been firmly proven.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Serran]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = A large moon orbiting Sonnah, far enough out to be easily detected by studying Sonnah's transit data.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Jool]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Jull
			%description = A Jool-mass gas giant orbiting Novus Horizontum.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Dres]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Drus
			%description = Not much is known about the small moons of Jull.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Duna]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Dunar
			%description = Not much is known about the moons of Jull.

	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Ike]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Newton
			%description = Not much is known about the moons of Jull.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Leouch]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Not much is known about the moons of Jull.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Nolas]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Not much is known about the moons of Jull.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Titanus]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = A large super-kerbin-mass planet orbiting Novus Horizontum. It is not known whether this body is a solid world, a mini-neptune, or something in between, but the one thing that astronomers can universally agree on is that Titanus is a hilarious name.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Ete]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Not much is known about the moons of Titanus.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Tylo]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Tillo
			%description = An as-yet unconfirmed satellite found orbiting Titanus, with a radius similar to that of Kerbin.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Oree]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Not much is known about the moons of Titanus.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Eeloo]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Eelol
			%description = An as-yet unconfirmed small planet orbiting Novus Horizontum. Only one transit has been observed, so no one knows what its orbital period is, beyond "at least as long as the time that has yet passed since the last transit."
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Minmus]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Minmeloo
			%description = The presence of any satellites around Eelol is purely conjectural.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Vanor]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Vanor, like Eelol, had only been observed during a single transit event, and for a long time was completely unconfirmed for a long time, up until the development of gigantic interferometric infrared-light telescopes larger than Kerbin. While most of the planets were lost in the glare from Novus Horizontum, Vanor was far enough out to be observed up close--several moons have even been discovered with this technique!
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Tidus]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Although never observed directly, Tidus was discovered by its effect on Vanor, causing it to noticeably wobble over a few hours.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[NH/Pol]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = T'pol
