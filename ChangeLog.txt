About Arin's rings I noticed that they have the same inclination as Astid's orbit, but the planes are not aligned. I am actually wondering whether this is intended or whether Astid is actually supposed to orbit along the outside of Arin's rings. Since Astid's description seems to indicate that Astid may originate from a different impact than Arin's rings, it might actually be intended the way it is, but to me it seems more reasonnable to see Astid as a piece of rock which is part of Arin's rings, in which case the planes should be aligned. I haven't tried it myself yet, but I think adding the line "longitudeOfAscendingNode = 50" inside of the "Rings"\"Ring" node in the Arin.cfg file should align Arin's rings with the orbital plane of Astid...?
